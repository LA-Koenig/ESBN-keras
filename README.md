# ESBN-keras

The Emergent Symbol Binding Network is a relatively new network that might have potential for extrapolation (Webb et al.). The
original implementation is written using PyTorch. Both because of the novelty and to prepare for further research the goal of this
project is to create a TensorFlow implementation of the ESBN. The differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow are causing
fundamental issues with the implementation and the TensorFlow version isnâ€™t converging at this time.
